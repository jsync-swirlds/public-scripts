# Snippets
This repo forms a personal log of daily activity. The script dailyCommit.sh, when run, commits the current changes,
marked with the date for the day, and pushes those changes to the upstream system.  Best used with a personal github
(or gitlab/bitbucket/etc...) repository to form a traceable daily updated log of activity.

The Archives folder contains annual (or more frequent) files, representing the activity for that year, created by
copying the Snippets file at the end of the year, then clearing the prior year's entries from Snippets.text.

The Endnotes folder is for commentary, references, and any other content that is referred to by a Snippet, but is
too large to keep in the Snippet itself (Snippets generally should be no more than 10-20 lines each).
