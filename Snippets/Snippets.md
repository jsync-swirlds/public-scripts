Instructions:
* Write a brief description of daily accomplishments here at
  the end of each day.
* Use markdown syntax.
   1. Most items should be either ordered or unordered lists.
   1. ordered lists should not attempt to match numbers,
      let markdown do that.
   1. try to avoid more than 4 levels of depth; most items
      should be 1 or 2 levels at most.
   1. long lines may be split, but should retain indentation.
* Add a single horizontal line (30 dashes is recommended)
  as a "current day" separator, for ease of finding the
  current day if your editor doesn't retain position
* Use your favorite plain text editor
   * This is just a text file; do not use tools like
     MS-Word or rich text editors; the binary format those
     programs use will prevent github from rendering
     the file correctly.
* Include an endnotes reference at the end of the file,
  like the example here.
* Copy this file to the `Archives` folder at the end of
  each review period (quarter, half-year, year) and name
  appropriately, then trim those dates from this file to
  keep it's length reasonable.
* Include larger details (i.e. deep discussions, goal
  descriptions, periodic review feedback, etc...
  in separate files in the Endnotes folder, and only
  refer to those by filename here.
   * Example:
      Received feedback: `Endnotes/2022-01-18-Review-Feedback.text`

-------------------- Example --------------------

2022-01-19
* Worked on widget Alpha for FTR design
   * Made good progress on the micro-encabulator description.
      * Still need to work out how to incorporate the
        frambular encoder.
   * Cleaned up some aspects of the
     turbo-synchro-defrangilor
      * This should save good 50-100 gwei per revolution.
* Reviewed the latest Dankflubbing proposal, and left
  useful feedback
* Merged the hollow-frambulous wiring diagram
   * Frodo and Pipin had good feedback on the pull request,
     which was incorporated.

------------------------------

2022-01-20
